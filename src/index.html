      Solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment has grown at unprecedented rates since
      the early 2000s. Global installed PV capacity reached 222 gigawatts (GW)
      at the end of 2015 and is expected to rise further to 4,500 GW by 2050.
      Particularly high cumulative deployment rates are expected by that time in
      China (1,731 GW), India (600 GW), the United States (US) (600 GW), Japan
      (350 GW) and Germany (110 GW). As the global PV market increases, so will
      the volume of decommissioned PV panels. At the end of 2016, cumulative
      global PV waste streams are expected to have reached 43,500-250,000 metric
      tonnes. This is 0.1%-0.6% of the cumulative mass of all installed panels
      (4 million metric tonnes). Meanwhile, PV waste streams are bound to only
      increase further. Given an average panel lifetime of 30 years, large
      amounts of annual waste are anticipated by the early 2030s. These are
      equivalent to 4% of installed PV panels in that year, with waste amounts
      by the 2050s (5.5‑6 million tonnes) almost matching the mass contained in
      new installations (6.7 million tonnes). Growing PV panel waste presents a
      new environmental challenge, but also unprecedented opportunities to
      create value and pursue new economic avenues. These include recovery of
      raw material and the emergence of new solar PV end-of-life industries.
      Sectors like PV recycling will be essential in the world’s transition to a
      sustainable, economically viable and increasingly renewablesbased energy
      future. To unlock the benefits of such industries, the institutional
      groundwork must be laid in time to meet the expected surge in panel waste.
      This report presents the first global projections for future PV panel
      waste volumes to 2050. It investigates and compares two scenarios for
      global PV panel waste volumes until 2050. • Regular-loss: Assumes a
      30-year lifetime for solar panels, with no early attrition; • Early-loss:
      Takes account of “infant”, “mid-life” and “wear-out” failures before the
      30-year lifespan. Policy action is needed to address the challenges ahead,
      with enabling frameworks being adapted to the needs and circumstances of
      each region or country. Countries with the most ambitious PV targets are
      expected to account for the largest shares of global PV waste in the
      future, as outlined by case studies in this report. By 2030 the top three
      countries for cumulative projected PV waste are projected to include
      China, Germany and Japan. At the end of 2050 China is still forecast to
      have accumulated the greatest amount of waste but Germany is overtaken by
      the United States of America (US). Japan comes next followed by India. At
      present, only the European Union (EU) has adopted PV-specific waste
      regulations. Most countries around the world classify PV panels as general
      or industrial waste. In limited cases, such as in Japan or the US, general
      waste regulations may include panel testing for
