      The US will impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from India "plus an
      unspecified penalty" for buying Russian oil and weapons, President Trump
      has said. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said the measures
      would take effect from from 1 August, the US deadline for a trade deal. He
      described India as a friend whose "tariffs are far too high, among the
      highest in the world". He also criticised India's purchases of Russian
      military equipment and energy "when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE
      KILLING IN UKRAINE". India said it was committed to "concluding a fair,
      balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement". Last year,
      the US had a trade deficit of $45.8bn (Â£26.1bn) with India.
